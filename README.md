# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section

![Design preview for the Testimonials grid section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Building of project

While building this project tried many approaches to build a replica but a lot of them didn't work out as I planned so I used flexbox and media queries to build it, I 
divided it into sections to make the process easy The best practice to solve a challenge like this is to use generic class names or id's which saves the iterative 
process.
